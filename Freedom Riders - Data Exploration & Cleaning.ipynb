    "Googled how to find consolidated information on the countries of the world. Best consolidated source result was cia.gov whom produces an annual world factbook. After reviewing the information on the CIA site, searched for 'CIA API documentation' to start and got a Git repository that ended up having a complete 2019 CIA factbook in .json format. Therefore, it was easy enough to download the 2019 CIA data.\n",

    "The complication came in the fact that there is no true documentation. Searching for it leads to the Git repository where the data file resides. Went back to the CIA site to find the factbook guide, which outlines the layout of information and how it is sorted/nested in the print/html versions. This is related to, but not specifically how, the .json is laid out. Ended up manually chaining out and discovering the keys needed to get the information to answer questions. The exploration, resulted in MASSIVE amounts of data; much more than needed for the project. Pulled in the specifics needed and moved on. Only 'keyed-out' about an estimated-third of the data types in the file, so there is much more to be revealed!\n",

    "Started by simply trying country names from the EFI data as keys for in the CIA data. Sid this with try/except and printed the exceptions as an error list so we could target what to clean. First run, all countries errored out. Reviewed the cia_facts\\['countries'\\].keys() and noted they were all lower case. Adjusted code to include .lower() and got far fewer items on the error list.\n",

There were enough countries in the EFI set with a hanging space on the end that it was better to generate a list with that corrected first, then send the resulting list through the secondary cleaning process. Secondary cleaning filled spaces, replaced hyphens, adjusted spelling/special characters as needed, and reordered ancillary naming terms like North/South/The, etc.\n",

It was because the data in the dataframe from (list(zip)) was 1 item short for two of the lists. Once I added those additional 2 lists to the exception I was good to go. The originating exception was a KeyError for 1 country that didn't have per capita data points so I had to calculate it via the overall GDP and the population.\n",
